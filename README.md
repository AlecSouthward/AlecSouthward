## Hey there!

Here are some fun facts about me:

- I'm currently working on an AI that is designed specifically for entertainment (will be used mainly as a Discord bot in a call).
- Created some Godot addons a while back, they were made with flexibility and usability in mind.
- I think that a decent amount of indie games are gems.
- Former Indie Game Developer, only really liked programming and not the art and music side of things.
- Hit me up on Discord if you wanna ask me something (my username is `itsmealec`).
