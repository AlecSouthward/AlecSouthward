### About Me

- Currently building an **open-source, self-hosted Dungeons & Dragons** platform to help run and manage campaigns.
- Previously developed a **Discord-based entertainment AI**, now on hiatus until I upgrade my hardware.
- Created a few [Godot addons](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset?user=ItsMeAlec) focused on flexibility and usability.
- Indie games are often **underrated gems** — I love finding the good ones.
- Former indie game dev! I enjoyed the coding side of things, not so much the art or audio.
